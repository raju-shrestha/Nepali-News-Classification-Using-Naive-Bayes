# Nepali-News-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes

Nepali News Classification Using Naïve Bayes algorithm is successfully implemented in 
Python programming language. A system has been built for classifying the content of the news
article into different categories collected from a major Nepali language newspaper published 
in Nepal. This project evaluates some widely used machine learning techniques i.e. Naïve 
Bayes for automatic Nepali News classification. It classifies the news by analyzing the content 
of the news. Since the Nepali language is morphologically rich and complex, the text classifier 
needs to consider the specific language features before classifying the text. Thus, it is very 
important to have an appropriate model for classifying the news articles into different category. 
The accuracy of the model on test data set is 82.20 %
